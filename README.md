KD Tree Implementation for conducting range searches on mobile devices

This algorithm came about as I was researching a solution on how to conduct effective searches using more than 1 dimension and over ranges from a mobile device.
Query performance degrades exponentially as more dimensions are added. To mitigate this we sort the data on each dimension and save the sorted sets in the database for
faster searches
